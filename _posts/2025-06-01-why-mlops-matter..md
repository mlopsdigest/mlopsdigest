Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are rapidly reshaping society and technology. While the ML impact is real and is changing society, real-world implementations remain problematic, unreliable, and immamture. The excitement in the media often exceeds the current pratical capabilities. Given that, to naviate complexity, organizations should initially addopt simple, standardized practices rather than overly complex, ad-hoc experiments. The focus here is to build for long-term sophistication in terms of simple and standard foundation that will eventually help companies achieve depper integration in ML usage.

Machine Learning global adoption has created a need for systematic approaches when building ML Systems. This lead to a rise in demand for Engineers specialized in ML to apply established DevOps practices to Machine Learning technologies. Simple as that.

One interesting pattern about Machine Learning in general, is how is tied with cloud platforms. That its because the core aspects of ML happen mostly in the cloud, since they require massive computing power, data and specialized hardware, like GPUS for Deep Learning Containers, training or inference.

Given this, many cloud platforms built their own Machine Learning Platforms for ML operationalization. This often means centralized platforms with all the infrastructure needed to train and deploy models at scale.(e.g. Azure ML, AWS SageMaker, Google Vertex AI and Databricks Mosaic AI)

> But this does’t stop other companies to build their their own custom platforms. In fact, as the ML maturity envolve, natural path for organization is to build their own custom platform.

## What is MLOps, really?

While people often associate ML with just “training models”, most of the time (and complexity), Machine Learning is more than this. It lies in everything that surrounds the model.

From Data Engineering tasks, like collecting, cleaning, transforming and validating data, to data processing, making sure the business problem can be solved with ML and the most important aspect: business alignment.

We could think of several bottlenecks in Machine Learning projects, like:

- Too much focus on the “code” instead of the “problem” results in teams often obsess over model architectures, hyperparameters or tools, like weather to use Pytorch or TensorFlow. But the real value comes from solving business problems, not writing fancy code.

- Lack of automation is another problem given many processes still manual, like labeling data, triggering retraining, monitoring drift, managing model versions etc.

- Sometimes decisions are made based on authority or intuition, not data. This leads to ML projects being launched or shut down for political reasons rather than experimental evidence.

- Solutions are not cloud-native or not production-ready. Many ML workflows relies on academic datasets, which are small, clean and unrealistic and the majority of the code are what we call “research” code. Code that sounds beautiful in a Jupyter notebook, but does’t scale or integrate with production systems.

The major reason MLOps emerged as a critical industry standard, it is because of all the bottlenecks we often see projects, making models not moving into production. Like in DevOps, MLOps must not have components of the system that have humans moving levers, doing repetitive tasks.MLOps helps bring coordination between developers, models and operations in daily work that is transparent and provides a healthy collaboration.

One could think MLOps as the process of automating Machine LEarning using DevOps best practices.

> Think of MLOps as the application of DevOps principles CI/CD, monitoring, versioning, and collaboration to Machine Learning workflows. But MLOps also adds layers unique to ML: dealing with data drift, training pipelines, model validation, and online metrics. It bridges the gap between model development and production, making ML **sustainable and scalable**.

When we talk about MLOps, we’re not focusing only on the software engineering aspect, but also data and modelling itself. It’s like adding the training and deployment of a model into the traditional DevOps. With it’s own particularities of course. As monitoring for when things break. In this case, data drift, A/B Testing, Online Metrics, and many more.

By definition, ML models are "code" as much the same way as a training pipeline, serving logic, and a data processing. Deploying new models carries significant risk: poorly managed rollout's can crash production systems or degrade the user experience through inaccurate or unstable recommendations.

In the end, ML begins and ends with data. It is impossible to integrate ML into business or applications, without understanding the data.

## The ML Lifecycle: A Continuous Process

Machine Learning applications never truly "finish"; they require continuous monitoring and iterative refinement. This means that continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) processes are inherently necessary, regardless of initial model performance.

The cross-functional collaboration is one of the most important aspects as well, because effective iteration demands collaboration among data scientists, ML engineers and business people. So think of these as a interdisciplinary effort to ensure alignment of technical work with business requirements/objectives.

We could think of the most basic tasks in ML as:

* Modifying training pipelines
* Feature engineering (adding, removing, or transforming features)
* Data augmentation or pruning
* Updating model architecture

In practice, the first model often serves merely as a baseline for further exploration and improvement. That's why is so important to develop experimentation systems that test models against online metrics using actual production data to properly evaluate and iteratively enhance model performance.


## From Data to Deployment: ML Lifecycle

### **Data Collection & Analysis**

This phase involves almost everyone product teams, analysts, platform engineers, even UX teams. Data must be aligned with business goals, whether that's improving profit margins, increasing engagement, or targeting customer segments. Clean, accessible, and well-managed data forms the foundation of any successful ML system.

### **Training Pipelines**

ML pipelines are **not standard ETL processes** theyre purpose-built for ML, integrating domain-specific algorithms and libraries like PyTorch or TensorFlow. Building them requires collaboration across roles: data engineers, scientists, ML engineers, and SREs.

### **Integration and Validation**

Models by themselves dont deliver value they must be integrated into software products to create real impact. This integration requires close coordination between business teams and engineers to ensure the model serves the intended purpose effectively. For example, an e-commerce recommendation model should be embedded directly into the checkout process, tested live in real user scenarios, and continuously monitored for performance.

> To validate such models safely and effectively, one can use strategies like shadow deployments (running the model in parallel without affecting user experience), incremental rollouts (gradually exposing traffic to the model), or A/B testing (comparing the models impact against a control group to assess business value).

### **Monitoring**

Models can fail silently data drift, unexpected inputs, or broken assumptions can degrade accuracy. MLOps enforces **ongoing monitoring** to detect and address issues early. Teams must define success metrics clearly, run offline and online evaluations, and continuously improve model reliability.

## MLOps is a Competitive Advantage

MLOps isnt just about technical hygiene its a strategic advantage that transforms experimental models into scalable, production-ready systems. Organizations that invest in MLOps benefit from faster deployment cycles, increased model reliability, improved cross-team collaboration, and the ability to iterate, experiment and innovate continuously. As Machine Learning becomes an integral part of modern business, mastering MLOps is essential to unlocking its full potential and staying competitive in a rapidly evolving landscape.
